Running the code::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Part 1 -Login. After running the application in the emulator. The app will open up on the sign-up page, fill in your details and upload a picture for your profile. 
It's an emulated device it wouldn't have any pictures in it; so to upload a picture you can just drag and drop an image from your local pc- It should be in downloaded 
images. Then click on the signup button then a verification link will be sent to your email and you need to verify that before moving forward. you can use the login 
details used during sign-up and click on the login button to log in.

Part 2 -Making a post There will be a bar at the top of the app. There are three components there- first the uploaded picture, second the text box to give 
the post a description, and the final part is the upload button. To upload an image follow the same steps in part 1 and then type in the caption you want
people to see. After those steps, you can finally post it, and scroll to the bottom of your feed to see the post.

Part 3 -Navigating through the menus- You will see multiple options- Home page, profile, friends, find friends, chat, and logout- From which only three of them
work profile, find friends, and logout. If you click the profile you can access a snapshot of your account details and change your credentials. If you want to look up 
your friends who also made an account on Interactive Diary, click on find friends. If you click on logout you can log out of your account.
